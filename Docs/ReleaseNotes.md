# UX Tools 0.11.0 release notes

- [What's new](#whats-new)
- [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes)

This release of the UX Tools supports only HoloLens 2. Support for other MR platforms remains a goal for us but is not the current focus.

Unreal 4.25 required.

## What's new

### Examples Plugin

UX Tools common content and example scenes were moved to a separate plugin to make it easier to incorporate them
as a starting point for new projects.
